# Titan AMM Integration Template

A reference implementation and test suite for adding AMMs, CLMMs, and proprietary liquidity engines to Titan’s routing layer.

## Overview

Titan aggregates liquidity from heterogeneous venues (AMMs, CLMMs, orderbooks, proprietary pools) under a single unified quoting and routing interface.

This repository provides:

- A compact `TradingVenue` template for describing quote math, token metadata, account loading, and swap instruction shape
- A robust boundary-search engine for computing safe swap-size ranges
- Token metadata utilities, including Token-2022 support
- A caching abstraction for efficient on-chain account loading
- Simulation tests using LiteSVM ensuring off-chain quotes match on-chain execution
- Pricing tests ensuring the reported marginal price is consistent with the quoted output
- A fully worked Raydium example implementation

This template is the starting point for integrating your AMM into Titan.

## On-Chain CPI Template

This repo also includes `program-template/`, an Anchor template for the venue CPI
adapter Titan's router program calls during routed swaps.

Use it to verify your venue's on-chain swap instruction shape against Titan
router account layout and TitanPDA custody:

```bash
cargo check --manifest-path program-template/Cargo.toml
make build-program
```

The program template includes a real Raydium AMM CPI example plus a minimal
`venues/template.rs` file showing the common venue adapter shape.

## Core Components

- `TradingVenue`: implement account parsing, state refresh, token metadata,
  protocol labeling, exact-in quote math, and swap instruction construction.
- `QuoteRequest` / `QuoteResult`: Titan routes `ExactIn` only. All amounts and
  prices use raw atom units, not UI decimal scaling.
- `QuoteResult::price`: report the marginal derivative
  `d(output_atoms) / d(input_atoms)`. It must be positive, non-increasing, and
  consistent with `expected_output`.
- `bounds`: finds safe input ranges from a zero-input-safe `quote()`.
- `TokenInfo`: covers SPL Token, Token-2022, and transfer fee metadata. Do not
  duplicate transfer-fee handling in quote math.
- `AccountsCache`: loads required on-chain accounts with RPC caching.

## Included Tests

Every venue must pass the same shared suite in `tests/common/mod.rs`, run through
`tests/example.rs` for the Raydium reference and `tests/your_venue.rs` for your
integration.

- Construction and boundaries: deserialization, state loading, token info,
  boundary quotes, and no heap allocation inside `quote()`.
- Simulation: LiteSVM swaps compare on-chain output to off-chain `quote()` at
  boundaries and random samples, while checking accounts, monotonicity, and
  quote speed.
- Pricing: `price` must be positive, non-increasing, and bracket the realized
  average rate: `price(b) <= (f(b) - f(a)) / (b - a) <= price(a)`. The tests
  include atom-rounding slack for truncated integer outputs.

## Implementing Your Own Venue

Fill in the skeleton at **`src/your_venue/mod.rs`**, then wire the matching tests,
route builder, and program template files below. `program-template/...` means
`program-template/programs/titan-v3-venue-template`.

| Layer | File | Function / item | Update required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Creation parser | `src/your_venue/mod.rs` | `YOUR_PROGRAM_ID` | Replace with your venue's on-chain program id. |
| Creation parser | `src/your_venue/mod.rs` | `parse_pool_creations()` | Detect real pool-creation instructions and return `PoolCreation { protocol, pool, mints }`. |
| Creation parser | `tests/your_venue_creation.rs` | constants + `your_venue_pool_creation()` | Add a no-RPC fixture for one real pool-creation instruction. |
| Quote layer | `src/trading_venue/protocol.rs` | `PoolProtocol::YourPoolProtocol` | Rename or replace with your real protocol variant and display string. |
| Quote layer | `src/your_venue/mod.rs` | `YourVenue` fields | Add the pool state your quote math needs. |
| Quote layer | `src/your_venue/mod.rs` | `FromAccount::from_account()` | Deserialize the pool account and record state accounts to refresh. |
| Quote layer | `src/your_venue/mod.rs` | `protocol()` | Return your real `PoolProtocol` variant. |
| Quote layer | `src/your_venue/mod.rs` | `update_state()` | Fetch accounts through `AccountsCache`, deserialize live state, populate `token_info`, and initialize the venue. |
| Quote layer | `src/your_venue/mod.rs` | `quote()` | Implement exact-in quote math, including raw-atom marginal price. |
| Quote layer | `src/your_venue/mod.rs` | `generate_swap_instruction()` | Build your venue's swap instruction with the same per-leg `AccountMeta` shape the route builder will pass through. |
| Quote layer | `tests/your_venue.rs` | `pool()` + `programs()` | Point the shared off-chain suite at a real pool and required program binaries. |
| Route builder | `src/swap_route/mod.rs` | `Venue` enum | Add your route-builder venue variant in the same position and shape as the program template enum. |
| Route builder | `src/swap_route/mod.rs` | `protocol_to_venue()` | Map your `PoolProtocol` to your route-builder `Venue`; include any CPI parameters the program template must pass to your adapter. |
| Program layer | `program-template/.../src/state.rs` | `Venue` enum | Add the matching program-template venue variant, including any CPI parameters your adapter needs. |
| Program layer | `program-template/.../src/instructions/venues/template.rs` | `swap(<venue fields>, amount_in, account_metas)` | Replace this template with your venue CPI adapter: set program id, discriminator, and exact-in serialization. If renamed, remove the old placeholder so the scorecard no longer sees the default id. |
| Program layer | `program-template/.../src/instructions/venues/mod.rs` | `pub mod <venue>;` | Register your venue CPI adapter. |
| Program layer | `program-template/.../src/instructions/swap_route_v3.rs` | `perform_cpi_swap()` | Dispatch your `Venue` variant to your venue CPI adapter. |
| Program layer | `program-template/.../tests/venue_parity.rs` | parity cases | Add cases proving the route-builder and program-template venue enums serialize identically. |
| Program layer | `program-template/.../tests/your_venue_route.rs` | `pool()` + `venue_programs()` | Point the route simulation at a real pool and CPI program dependencies. |

If your swap CPI touches additional runtime programs, include them in
`program_dependencies()` and in the test program lists above.

### Running the tests

```bash
make build-program   # build the Titan router program template
make check-structure # fast no-RPC sanity checks
make test-example   # the Raydium reference suite — always green
make test-venue     # YOUR venue's suite (red until you implement YourVenue)
make scorecard      # print the integration scorecard only
make dump-programs  # fetch the program binaries the simulation tests load
```

The example and your venue run the *same* shared suite, so both are held to the
same bar. Everything runs cleanly on a fresh clone: the construction, simulation,
and pricing tests need a mainnet RPC endpoint (and, for the simulations, dumped
program binaries), so they **SKIP with an explanation** instead of failing when
those prerequisites are absent. To run them for real:

```bash
export SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://...   # a mainnet RPC endpoint
make build-program                  # rebuild the Titan router program template
make dump-programs                  # one-time: dump the venue programs into programs/
make test-example
make test-venue
```

`make check-structure` runs unit tests, scorecard assertions, and `Venue` enum
parity checks without requiring RPC.

`make scorecard` prints both scorecard sections: the *Example* section is your
always-green baseline (all four layers wired), and the *Your venue* section
tracks which placeholders you've replaced across the creation parser, quote,
program, and route-builder layers.

If your venue passes the suite, your quote() logic is sufficient to be assessed by
our team and go through the next stages of integration.

## Tips for Integrators
1. Always support zero-input quoting
2. Keep your deserialization strictly defensive, never panic
3. Don’t perform I/O, allocate heap memory, or panic inside quote()
4. A quote must average under 1 microsecond (1µs) — see the quoting_speed test
5. Make sure your instruction accounts match the program’s expectations
6. Report a marginal `price` in raw output atoms per raw input atom — positive, non-increasing in size, and consistent with `expected_output`

## Coffer venue

This fork implements the template for **Coffer / Cube DEX**
(mainnet program `8iQtGj9mcUfFUGaiCpPy89swC3s8YTC8FhVZWfgeZhwu`, contract
branch `main`): a 2..=10-token weighted AMM with virtual liquidity, a
ceil-rounded swap fee with a protocol cut, a per-token sliding-window sell-off
cap and a surge fee that rises as that window fills.

### Naming

The product is Coffer; the on-chain program crate still carries its earlier
internal name. This repository uses Coffer names everywhere. Wire
compatibility is untouched: every Anchor discriminator is a hard-coded byte
constant (`src/coffer_venue/instruction.rs`, pinned by a unit test to the
sha256 digest of its wire name, given as hex), the pool PDA seed keeps its
bytes as a byte-array literal, and the verbatim port is generated from the
contract source through a deterministic rename map
(`scripts/port_coffer_math.py`; the same map is applied by
`tests/coffer_source_parity.rs` before comparing).

### What is implemented

| Layer | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Verbatim math port | `src/coffer/{constants,math/*}.rs` are byte-for-byte copies of the contract modules (only `use` lines differ); `src/coffer/swap.rs` embeds the swap handler's guard / fee / curve / surge-fee / payout / state-update segments verbatim; `src/coffer/{state,errors,prelude}.rs` mirror the Anchor-only pieces. `tests/coffer_source_parity.rs` diffs all of it against the contract source and fails on drift. Regenerate with `python3 scripts/port_coffer_math.py [<Coffer src dir>]`. The `coffer` module is `#[rustfmt::skip]` for that reason. |
| Quote layer | `src/coffer_venue/mod.rs` — `CofferVenue` (`PoolProtocol::Coffer`, displayed as `"Coffer"`), `parse_pool_creations`, `update_state` (pool + mints + Clock sysvar), `directions_num`, `quote`, `generate_swap_instruction`, `AddressLookupTableTrait`. `price.rs` is the closed-form marginal price; `instruction.rs` the `swap` builder. |
| Route builder | `Venue::Coffer { token_in_index, token_out_index }` in `src/swap_route/mod.rs`. |
| Program layer | `program-template/.../venues/coffer.rs` CPI adapter, dispatch in `swap_route_v3.rs`, parity cases in `tests/venue_parity.rs`, route simulation in `tests/your_venue_route.rs`. |
| Production bytecode | `programs/8iQtGj9mcUfFUGaiCpPy89swC3s8YTC8FhVZWfgeZhwu.so` (sha256 `5128c578…`, committed, pinned by the fixture suite) so the offline fixtures run the exact mainnet build. |

Quote semantics: every on-chain guard runs first; `amount == 0` returns zero
output and the spot price; a swap the sell-off window would reject
(`MaxSelloffExceeded`) or whose curve output exceeds the LP-owned balance
(`AmountOutExceedsBalance`) is a **partial fill** (`not_enough_liquidity =
true`, `amount` = the largest input the program accepts, `expected_output` at
that size); `ZeroFeeAmount` and arithmetic failures are errors; the handler's
post-swap balance updates are re-run as overflow checks so the quote fails on
exactly the inputs the program rejects. `minimum_amount_out` is 0 (the router
enforces slippage on the route). `price = d(user_output)/d(amount_in)`, the
derivative of the continuous curve times `(1 - surge_rate)` at the post-swap
window position.

### Test tiers

```bash
# 1. no RPC: unit tests, verbatim-port parity, scorecard, enum parity
make check-structure
cargo test --release --test coffer_source_parity   # needs ../contracts or COFFER_CONTRACT_SRC=<program crate>/src

# 2. no RPC: LiteSVM fixtures against the pinned production ELF
cargo test --release --test coffer_fixtures -- --nocapture

# 3. RPC-gated: the shared suite on live pools, and the route program
export SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://...
make build-program && make dump-programs
make test-example
make test-venue            # COFFER_TEST_POOL=<pubkey> narrows to one pool
cargo run --release --example mvt_diag   # per-direction MVT residual report
```

Tier 2 builds synthetic pools with the real layout, PDA seeds and ATAs, and
proves against the production program: exact payouts and exact post-swap pool
state on size grids; the exact `MaxSelloffExceeded` boundary (largest passing
input = the reported partial-fill amount); split-vs-whole sequences with a
state refresh between legs; window rotation after one and two periods incl.
the carry-over rescale when the snapshot changes; five surge-curve shapes
(kinked, no kink, threshold 0, near-100% threshold, 20/80 weights); a zero-fee
pool; dust inputs; output capped by the LP balance (protocol fees excluded);
deactivated input token / disabled pool / disabled swaps; a 10-token pool with
Token-2022 mints and two capped slots; the u64 balance ceiling.

Live pools used by tier 3 (`tests/your_venue.rs`): `5dDez…` (4 tokens, a
Token-2022 mint), `CSgrE…` (9 tokens; slot 6 has a LIVE 10% sell-off cap with an
80% → 25% surge curve), `BN4wp…` (80/20 weights), `AL4yx…` (LP balance far
below the virtual balance). The route simulation uses `5dDez…` and `BN4wp…`.

### Measured

- Quote latency (Apple M-series, `--release`): ~0.2 µs for a plain quote,
  ~0.5 µs on a fixture grid, ~0.7 µs with the cap and surge fee active
  (`quote_latency_report`, `examples/quote_bench.rs`). The template's
  `quoting_speed` test passes on all four live pools.
- Exact on-chain parity: `bound_simulation` / `random_samples` pass on all four
  live pools (200 random sizes per direction, 88 directions) and the route
  simulation passes on every direction of both route pools.

### Known limitations

- **`mean_value_theorem` (shared suite) is red on two of the four live pools.**
  The contract rounds the swap fee UP in *input* atoms, so the exact output
  curve is a staircase with a flat step every `1/fee_rate` atoms. The shipped
  test allows two *output* atoms of slack per chord; on directions that pay
  more than ~2 output atoms per input atom (e.g. USDC → BONK, USDC → a
  12-decimal mint) one input atom of fee rounding on a chord of 40–250 atoms
  exceeds it. Measured: violations only at input sizes ≤ 110 809 atoms, worst
  5.7% (2%-fee pool, ~50-atom chord containing one fee step); no pointwise
  price can pass there (a chord with a step followed by one without forces
  `p(b) ≤ chord₁ < chord₂ ≤ p(b)`). With one input atom of slack —
  `atol = (2 + price_a) / (b - a)` — every one of the 88 directions passes with
  zero violations (`examples/mvt_diag.rs`). The Raydium reference is unaffected
  only because its output/input atom ratio is ~1.4.
- The surge fee on-chain is a 4-segment, ceil-per-segment charge (conservative
  by construction); `price` is the derivative of the continuous model. The
  residual beyond the fee-rounding slack measured 7.3e-5 on the worst fixture
  (`pricing_invariants_under_surge_with_residual_report`).
- The window arithmetic uses the Clock sysvar captured at `update_state`; a
  stale clock near a window boundary makes the off-chain window position differ
  from the leader's. Refresh the clock with the pool.
- Overflow of the vault *token account* (`vault + amount_in > u64::MAX`) is not
  predicted from pool state alone; it needs more than `2^64 - vault` atoms.
- `parse_pool_creations` targets the `main` instruction shape (mints in
  `remaining_accounts`); pre-upgrade creations that passed a `tokens` vector
  are not recognised.
- Inactive tokens can still be bought; sidelined tokens (`actual_balance ==
  0`) are excluded as outputs from `directions_num`.

### Local-validator matrix (sell-off window + surge fee, end to end)

`scripts/local-stand/` brings up a `solana-test-validator` with the production
Coffer ELF at the mainnet program id, the Titan router built from
`program-template` at `T1TAN…`, and the live `CofferPoolConfig` (`E9K7…`,
`protocol_admin` rewritten to the local wallet so `set_pool_enabled` can be
exercised). `local-stand setup` then creates local mints (BONK-like 5 dec,
USDC-like 6 dec, SOL-like 9 dec, a metadata-only Token-2022 mint), the
TitanPDA, and one real pool per configuration below — created, seeded and
configured with the local wallet as pool admin — and writes
`scripts/local-stand/stand.json`.

```bash
make build-program                 # router ELF for the validator
scripts/local-stand/up.sh          # validator + mints + 26 pools (~2 min); prints the addresses
scripts/local-stand/run-matrix.sh  # tiers 1-4 in order, logs in scripts/local-stand/logs/
```

Tiers (`tests/local_stand_matrix.rs`, `program-template/.../tests/local_stand_route.rs`):

1. Titan's shared suite (all eight tests) on every static pool, plus
   `construction` under the allocation guard;
2. the program-template route simulation (`swap_route_v3` in LiteSVM) on every
   static pool, every direction;
3. REAL `swap_route_v3` transactions through the router on the validator for
   every direction of every static pool at three sizes (lower bound,
   geometric middle, upper bound), comparing the user's ATA delta AND the
   post-swap pool account with `quote()` / `apply_swap`;
4. dynamic sequences on dedicated pools: chunked sells (direct and routed)
   until the window is full, the full window reported as unavailable while the
   program reverts with `MaxSelloffExceeded`, buy side unaffected, surge fee
   accrual in the output token's protocol bucket, the 100%-fee exhaustion
   point, real-time rotation on a 20-second window, and the
   `set_token_active` / `set_swaps_enabled` / `set_pool_enabled` toggles.

Configuration matrix (BONK is slot 0 and capped; `(cap, period, threshold,
low/mid/high, kink)`; see `CASES` in `src/bin/local_stand.rs`):

| case | pool | config |

Results of the last clean run (`scripts/local-stand/results/`, reproduced by
`up.sh && run-matrix.sh`; 26 pools, 4 mints):

| tier | result |
| --- | --- |
| 1 shared suite | 19 static pools × 8 tests: everything passes except `mean_value_theorem` on the 17 pools that have a USDC → BONK direction (see below); `construction` also passes under the allocation guard |
| 2 route simulation | 19/19 pools, every direction, 430 legs exact |
| 3 real routed txs | 126 `swap_route_v3` transactions on the validator, 126 exact against the quote AND the predicted pool account (one, on the 20 s pool, exact once the venue clock is set to the block time); `l_swaps_off` / `l_pool_off`: quote refuses, program reverts 6021 / 6020; `k_inactive`: BONK direction absent, selling reverts 6054, buying exact; max 284 428 CU per routed tx with the surge active |
| 4 dynamic | windows filled in chunks on b / c / 80-20 c (direct) and b (routed, 10 chunks crossing the kink) with every chunk exact; full window → direction absent, `bounds` errors, quote reports 0 fillable, program reverts `MaxSelloffExceeded`, buy side exact; surge accrual in the USDC protocol bucket equals the sum of the predicted per-chunk fees (2 194 516 753 atoms on b); 100%-fee config: exhaustion point executed exactly, selling past it pays 0 on-chain; 20 s window: fill, rotate after one period (carry-over headroom sold exactly), fresh cap after two; deactivate / swaps-off / pool-off toggles behave as quoted and revert 6054 / 6021 / 6020 |

Findings from the matrix:

- A routed Coffer leg with the surge fee active does NOT fit the router's
  default 200 000 CU: the router spends ~45k CU creating the TitanPDA ATAs and
  the 4-segment surge charge costs the swap four extra curve evaluations
  (`<program> … consumed 123388 of 123388 compute units … exceeded CUs
  meter`). Measured per routed tx: 160–168k CU without surge, 250–285k with it.
  The LiteSVM harness simulates at 1.4M CU, which is why the route simulation
  never showed it. Tier 3/4 prepend `SetComputeUnitLimit(600_000)`; Titan's
  router client must budget accordingly.
- The sell-off window is a function of the clock. A quote at clock `t` and a
  transaction landing at block time `t' > t` differ when the window rotates in
  between (20 s pool) or when a non-zero carry-over decays with the surge
  active; tier 3/4 re-quote with the venue clock set to the block time and
  report those as "exact only at block time" (1 of 126 routed txs, on the
  20 s pool). Refresh the Clock together with the pool.
- With a curve that reaches 100% at full fill (b, c, g, e, w8020 …) the last
  atom(s) of the window cannot be sold for any output; the venue refuses them
  (zero fillable) while the program accepts them and pays 0. Selling past the
  100%-fee threshold of config d pays 0 as well; the venue reports the
  threshold as the fillable amount.
- The contract rejects a kink at or below the threshold and a kink of 100
  (`InvalidSurgeFeeConfig`): "threshold 99.9% with kink 99", "kink 100" and
  "threshold 50% with kink 50" are not deployable; the matrix uses the closest
  legal shapes (e, e2, f, g_kink99).
- `mean_value_theorem` fails on every pool with USDC → BONK (5 000 BONK atoms
  per USDC atom): the ceil'd input-side fee staircase, see above (worst 6.0e-3
  on the 80/20 pools, all at sizes ≤ ~2e5 USDC atoms). On the surge-active
  configs a second residual appears beyond the input-atom slack — the
  4-segment surge charge over-collects by an amount that varies with size:
  1.05e-4 (b), 1.21e-4 (g_kink99), 2.83e-5 (w8020_b) and 1.71e-3 on g_kink1
  (a kink at 1% makes the first segment's average rate the coarsest); zero on
  every other configuration.
